# Microservice-Application-CI-CD-Pipeline-on-Jenkins-and-Kubernetes

Developed and managed 11 microservices, each in separate branches for better version control and collaboration.
– Integrated Jenkinsfile in each microservice branch to automate CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient build and deployment.
– Implemented multibranch pipeline with webhook triggers for automatic pipeline execution, reducing manual intervention
and feedback cycles.
– Built Docker images for each microservice using CI pipelines and automatically pushed them to a Docker repository.
– Streamlined deployments with a unified CD pipeline for consistent and error-free releases across microservices.
– Implemented port forwarding to access the monitoring application running on Kubernetes pods.
– Deployed applications on AWS EKS clusters, ensuring high availability and scalability.
